# ADXL345 Acceleromteter Setup in C++ and python

# Description

This repository offers two follow along codes that allow you to run a ADXL345 accelerometer off of a raspberry pi.
I used a Raspberry pi 4, but this will work for previous versions of Pis as well. These files will help someone get 
acquainted with the ADXL345 and the general setup before they start creating their own specific programs
